# ESP32-S3_Mastery
This project is me learning the ESP32-S3 by building things the way I would want to see them in a real embedded product: clear structure, C++, Wi-Fi, HTTPS, and a web UI that talks to the board in a useful way.

The fun part is the WebGPU front end. The ESP32-S3 is not running WebGPU itself; it serves a secure web app that runs in the browser and acts as a rich control and visualization surface for the device. That is useful because an embedded board can stay small, cheap, and focused on hardware control, while the browser handles the heavier graphics work, interactive tooling, and cross-platform UI. In practice, that means you can use an ESP32-S3 as a real networked device with a polished interface instead of being limited to serial logs, basic forms, or a separate native app.

The color of the Contrail matches the color of the LED on the ESP32-S3 development board.

## Build and flash (ESP-IDF + WSL)
PlatformIO is not used. Use ESP-IDF directly.

## HTTPS for WebGPU (recommended)
WebGPU requires a secure context, so serving the UI over HTTPS avoids the "WebGPU is not supported" error.

### Generate a local self-signed certificate (WSL)
```bash
cd /mnt/c/LocalRepo/ESP32-S3_Mastery/main/secrets/Hidden
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server_key.pem -out server_cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=esp32.local"
```

### What this does
- The build system auto-embeds `server_cert.pem` and `server_key.pem` if they exist.
- The HTTP server will start HTTPS on port 443 and serve the WebGPU UI securely.
- If the files are missing, it falls back to HTTP on port 80.

### A) Device already attached to WSL
PowerShell (Admin):

```
usbipd bind --busid 1-2
usbipd attach --wsl Ubuntu --busid 1-2 --auto-attach
```

WSL (Ubuntu):

```
. ~/esp/esp-idf/export.sh
cd /mnt/c/LocalRepo/ESP32-S3_Mastery
idf.py build
idf.py -p /dev/ttyACM0 flash monitor
```

Exit monitor with `Ctrl+]`.

Clean builds:

```
idf.py fullclean
```

Or lighter clean:

```
idf.py clean
```

### B) Port missing (/dev/ttyACM0 not present)
PowerShell (Admin):

```
usbipd list
usbipd bind --busid <BUSID>
usbipd attach --wsl Ubuntu --busid <BUSID> --auto-attach
```

Then repeat steps in A.

Tip: optional shell aliases (`~/.bashrc`):

```
alias idfenv='. ~/esp/esp-idf/export.sh'
alias mon='idf.py -p /dev/ttyACM0 monitor'
```

Example:

```
idfenv && cd /mnt/c/LocalRepo/ESP32-S3_Mastery && idf.py build && idf.py -p /dev/ttyACM0 flash monitor
```
